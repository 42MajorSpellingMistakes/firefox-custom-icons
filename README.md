# btw i have no idea if this poses any security risks so use on your own responsibility (yes i'm using that too, because i love it)
cheers<br>
also, i urge anyone wanting to do this do read the comments in the .css files<br>
(css comment example: /\*  comment, can be multi line \*/)<br>
btw you need to restart firefox after changing anything in the .css files if that helps<br>

# how to:
first this:<br>
things after live-testing aren't needed there<br>

# then get some image files 
in this example i use those by [lux](https://twitter.com/LuxxArt) (love ya art lux)<br>
https://twitter.com/LuxxArt/status/1727019006186664230<br>
name it firefox.png<br>
put it into the ["chrome"](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/937284) folder<br><br>
folder in question:<br>![folder view](folder.png)
<br>and that's probably all the setup for now<br><br><br>
working on other replaceable places<br>

# what's unfinished (i have no css skills):
this one on almost every firefox built-in page:<br>
![Alt text](bad1.png)<br>
(sidenote: to change the lockbar icon to custom thingy you need to uncomment one thing in the userChrome.css<br>
why?, because i'm not sure if there are more lock icons. for now it is set to change for when tooltip is either:<br>
"Verified by" or "" \[on firefox about:\])<br><br><br>

about:preferences:<br>
i've tried a lot<br>
![Alt text](bad2.png)<br><br><br>

and probably other things i forgot about<br>

# some other text
hey you no longer need to resize that one image :+1: (happy = this does support emotes)<br>
i may even learn web formating doing this<br>
finally a good use for my free time

# made by one dude who last touched CSS like two years ago for some ass competition that he failed miserably
