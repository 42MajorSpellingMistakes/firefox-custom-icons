# btw i have no idea if this poses any security risks so use on your own responsibility (yes i'm using that too, because i love it)
cheers<br>
also, i urge anyone wanting to do this do read the comments in the .css files<br>
(css comment example: /\*  comment, can be multi line \*/)<br>
btw you need to restart firefox after changing anything in the .css files if that helps


# how to etc:
first this thing<br>
https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/ <br>
things after live-testing aren't needed there<br>

# then get some image files 
in this example i use those by [lux](https://twitter.com/LuxxArt) (love ya art lux)<br>
https://twitter.com/LuxxArt/status/1727019006186664230<br>
name it firefox.png<br>
put it into the ["chrome"](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/937284) folder<br>
folder in question: ![folder view](folder.png)
and that's probably all the setup for now<br><br><br>
working on other icons

![how do i attach an image in this thing?](example.png)


# i have no idea how formating in this works
dunno took me somewhere around one to two hours to figure everything out

<br><br><br>
hey you no longer need to resize that one image :+1: (does this even support emotes?)<br>
i may even learn web formating doing this<br>
finally a good use for my free time
