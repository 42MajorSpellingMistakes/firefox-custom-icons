# btw i have no idea if this poses any security risks so use on your own responsibility (yes i'm using that too, because i love it)
cheers<br>
also, i urge anyone wanting to do this do read the comments in the .css files<br>
(css comment example: /\*  comment, can be span in multiple lines of code \*/)<br>
btw you need to restart firefox after changing anything in the .css files if that helps<br>

# then get some image files 
in this example i use those by [lux](https://twitter.com/LuxxArt) (love ya art lux)<br>
https://twitter.com/LuxxArt/status/1727019006186664230<br>
name it firefox.png<br>
put it into the ["chrome"](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/937284) folder<br><br>
folder example:<br>![folder view](img/folder.png)
<br>should be good for now<br><br><br>

![how do i attach an image in this thing?](img/example.png)

# what's unfinished (i have no css skills):
this one on almost every firefox built-in page:<br>
![Alt text](img/bad1.png)<br>
(sidenote: to change the padlock icon to custom thingy you need to uncomment two lines of code in the userChrome.css<br>
why?, because i'm not sure if there are more padlock icons. for now the commented configuration is set to change for when tooltip is either:<br>
"Verified by" or "" \[on firefox about:\*\])<br><br><br>

about:preferences:<br>
i've tried a lot<br>
![Alt text](img/bad2.png)<br><br><br>

and probably other things i forgot about<br>

# some other text
i'm going to set those on my school's PCs<br>
they can count on that

# made by one dude who last (and first) touched CSS like two years ago for some ass competition that he failed miserably
you can message me on my dc if you find something new/undone (there is): 42majorspellingmistakes<br><br><br>
pleas at least link the source when you copy paste it to someone's DMs<br>
as the unwriten rule states: always credit the artist<br>
good luck and have fun with your firefox o7<br>
